1. classes:
  - I have added a ton more GUI classes and planned out properly how they're supposed to interact to make the GUI.
  - I found problems with my old codes and fixed it. eg. i changed java.time.duration stuffs to chronoUnits thing.
  - I realised i misunderstood the save file and load file thing, but the effect of this issue is kinda minimal.

2. testing:
  - I have not done any new testings, but I have fixed the old test classes and check if they work again after
  making changes with my backend.

3. difficulties:
  - I don't know if i can finish my project in time.
  - The more I work on the GUI, the more I realise how complex the GUI for this project actually is, in order to
  support the functionalities properly.
  - I have made many GUI classes but I can't actually test if many of them work due to how interlinked the stuffs
  in my projects are, which is actually very terrifying.

4. workload used: about 45 hours (quite a lof was spent for brainstorming and planning the execution for GUI),
but yeah more stuffs need to be done

5. progress assessment: Still worried I can't make it in time. It feels like I am rather near finishing, but since I
couldnt test if many of the GUI classes work, and if the GUI and the backend will work tgt like how i expect them to,
I am really not sure if I can finish and submit the project before the stipulated deadline
